Problem description: 
 
ABC is a pharmaceutical company keen on understanding persistency of a drug based on 
physician prescriptions for patients. To tackle this, ABC has engaged an analytics company to 
automate the identification of persistency. This analytics firm has tasked Team Data Minders 
with creating an automated solution to evaluate and enhance the persistency of a drug for ABC. 
 
Data Understanding:  
 
The healthcare dataset comprises 69 columns with data types including 'object' and 'int64'. The 
target variable, "Persistency_Flag," is binary. 
Most of the columns contain binary data labeled "Y" and "N."  
Upon analysis, it was determined that only a few columns are numerical, while the rest are string 
data stored as 'object' type. 

Exploratory Data Analysis: 
No missing values ("N/A") were found in the dataset. Outliers identified in certain columns were 
removed, decreasing the dataset size from 3,424 to 2,956 entries. 
The dataset primarily consists of binary data, with entries marked as "Y" or "N." 
A correlation analysis using the phik matrix exposed multicollinearity among some columns, 
which will require attention during subsequent model training stages. 
What type of data you have got for analysis: 
 
•  Patient Information: 
o  Ptid: Patient ID 
o  Gender: Gender of the patient 
o  Race: Race of the patient 
o  Ethnicity: Ethnicity of the patient 
o  Region: Geographic region 
•  Medical Data: 
o  Persistency_Flag: Indicates whether the patient is persistent or non-persistent 
o  Age Bucket: Age range of the patient 
o  Ntm_Speciality: Specialty of the treating physician 
o  Ntm_Specialist_Flag: Indicates if the specialist is an NTM specialist 
o  Ntm_Speciality_Bucket: Bucketed specialty information 
o  Idn_Indicator: Indicator for IDN involvement 
o  Injectable_Experience_During_Rx: Experience with injectables during treatment 
 
The dataset contains 69 columns, mainly with binary data labeled "Y" or "N," and data types 
include 'object' and 'int64'. The target variable, "Persistency_Flag," is binary. 
 
 
What are the problems in the data (number of NA values, outliers, skewed, etc): 
 
Outliers: 
•  Summary statistics such as minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation show a 
potential presence of outliers in our data. Outliers will be further examined visually using box 
plots and histograms. 
•  Outliers were found and removed from the dataset, specifically in columns such as 
'dexa_freq_during_rx' and 'count_of_risks', reducing the dataset size from 3,424 to 2,956 entries. 
Skewness: 
•  Notable skewness in columns like Dexa_Freq_During_Rx and Count_Of_Risks. 
NA Values: There are no NA values in the dataset. 
What approaches you are trying to apply on your data set to overcome problems like NA 
value, outlier, etc, and why?: 
We will approach skewness using log or square root transformations, and we will approach 
outliers via capping in order to maintain data integrity. Outliers in the columns 
'dexa_freq_during_rx' and 'count_of_risks' were identified and removed to improve the reliability 
of the data for accurate analysis and modeling. 
Data Handling: With no NA values present, there was no need for strategies related to missing 
data. 

Data cleansing and transformation were done on the data.

In the healthcare dataset, numerical columns were standardized using StandardScaler 
to normalize the data distribution, which is crucial for models sensitive to the scale of input features.
Binary data represented as 'Y' and 'N' were converted to 0 and 1, and the target variable 'persistency_flag'
was encoded from 'Non-Persistent'/'Persistent' to 0/1. Categorical columns were transformed using OneHotEncoder
with the drop='first' option to prevent multicollinearity by creating binary columns for each category. 
Outliers in 'dexa_freq_during_rx' and 'count_of_risks' were removed based on their quantiles to eliminate 
extreme values that could skew the analysis. Duplicate entries were identified and removed to ensure data uniqueness.
Risk-related columns were converted from 'Yes'/'No' to 1/0, and an aggregate risk score was calculated by summing these
values, providing a summarized risk level for each record. The dataset was also grouped by various categories and analyzed 
to determine the counts of persistent and non-persistent cases per category, offering deeper insights into the data. 
This series of transformations enhances the dataset's integrity and usability for accurate modeling.

Results and conclusion:


When selecting models for ABC Pharmaceutical's project, we needed solutions capable of handling class imbalance 
and complex feature interactions. XGBoost was chosen for its ability to manage large datasets and highlight feature importance, 
critical for understanding drug persistency factors. The version without PCA preserved the interpretability of individual 
features. Random Forest was selected for its robustness against overfitting and its effectiveness in modeling non-linear 
relationships. Logistic Regression provided a straightforward, interpretable baseline for comparison.
MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) was included to capture complex, non-linear patterns in the data. 
Stacking was also employed to leverage the strengths of each individual model, combining their predictions
to potentially enhance overall accuracy and robustness. Each model incorporated class balancing techniques 
to ensure a fair representation of all classes in predictions, addressing the dataset's inherent imbalances.

Choice of Evaluation Metric: ROC AUC was chosen as the primary metric to assess model effectiveness because:
It effectively handles class imbalance by measuring the model's ability to discriminate between the classes
without being misled by the majority class. It is threshold-independent, providing a comprehensive measure of 
model performance across all classification thresholds. ROC curves were constructed for each model to visually assess 
their performance in distinguishing between the classes.

Detailed Results: The XGBoost model without PCA emerged as the superior model, yielding the highest ROC AUC score of 0.794.
This indicates its good capability in distinguishing between persistent and non-persistent cases. 

The analysis confirmed that XGBoost without PCA is ideally suited for operational deployment due to its robust performance
across various metrics. This model not only excels at predicting drug persistency but also offers insights into the features
most affecting persistency, which can guide more targeted interventions.
